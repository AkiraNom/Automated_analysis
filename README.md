# Automated_analysis

This code perfomrs automated data analysis and generates a PDF file as a final report. 

[ADInstruments](https://www.adinstruments.com/) is used to record murine electrocardiogram (ECG). The record ECG can be analyzed using LabChart and each analysis result will be exported as a csv file. This program is written to perform automated data analysis using the csv files generated by LabChart.  

**Improvement**: it seems that a pdf generation step is slower than I expected. Test another pdf handling package if it improves processing speed.
